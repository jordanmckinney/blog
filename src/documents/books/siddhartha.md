<p id="title">Siddhartha - Herman Hesse</p>

A sublime book about seeking, wisdom, enlightenment and life. 
Whenever I read Siddhartha I feel lighter, calmer, more enlightened -- as if I had gone on a mini-meditation retreat.
I think there is deep wisdom in Siddhartha -- each time I read it I find more.

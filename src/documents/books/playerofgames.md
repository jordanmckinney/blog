<p id="title">The Player of Games, Iain M. Banks</p>

The second book in the Culture series.
The Player of Games takes place largely within the Culture where people live forever on beautiful constructed worlds and have AI drones as friends.
This book delivered a lot of the detail regarding the Culture that I was hoping for in Consider Phlebas.

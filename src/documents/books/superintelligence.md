<p id="title">Superintelligence - Nick Bostrom</p>

I was an AI-optimist until reading this book.
Now I believe AI to be humanity's greatest existential threat _by far_.
Bostrom reasons through many seemingly rock-solid strategies for AI-safety and shows how almost every one of them utterly fails.
If you're not afraid of AI, read this book.

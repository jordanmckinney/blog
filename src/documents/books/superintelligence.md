<p id="title">Superintelligence - Nick Bostrom</p>

I was very much an AI optimist until discovering Bostrom's work. 
Bostrom reasons through in terrifying detail all the ways in which we might try to make safe AI, and how almost all approaches would utterly fail. 
I don't know how anyone could come away from Superintelligence without a feeling of awestruck terror at what seems to be just around the corner for humanity.

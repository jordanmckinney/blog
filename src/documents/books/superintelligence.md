<p id="title">Superintelligence - Nick Bostrom</p>

I was optimistic about AI until reading this book.
Now I believe AI to be humanity's greatest existential threat _by far_.
Of course AI holds tremendous promise, but the risks are total.
Bostrom reasons through many, many seemingly solid strategies for AI-safety and shows how almost all of them utterly fail.
If you're not deeply afraid of AI, read this book.


I don't know how anyone could come away from Superintelligence without a feeling of awestruck terror at what seems to be just around the corner for humanity.

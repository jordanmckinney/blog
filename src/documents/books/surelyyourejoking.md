Feynman was brilliant -- he is my model for how to think independently, reason from first-principles, and doubt convention.
His [description](https://youtu.be/v3pYRn5j7oI?list=PL2D30B1DEFFDA0310) of the world through the lens of physics ignited the love for physics which ultimately drove me to engineering.
He was also famously eccentric -- the stories of his adventures are hilarious.

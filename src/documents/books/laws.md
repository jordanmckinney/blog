<p id="title">48 Laws of Power - Robert Greene</p>

48 Laws is sometimes criticized for its Machiavellian nature, or lack of rigor in deriving of laws.
But the reason I love the book is that it's like a historic highlight reel of the most charismatic, ambitious, remarkable people who ever lived.
It is a rich collection of stories, spanning millenia, that gives a window into the great personalities of history.

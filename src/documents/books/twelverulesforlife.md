<p id="title">12 Rules For Life, Jordan Peterson</p>

Like one of Peterson's lectures this book is a weaving of evolutionary history, ancient religion, Nietzsche, Jung, Freud, practical "life hacks" (exposure therapy, how to deal with kids etc.), and answers to questions like "how should one live?".

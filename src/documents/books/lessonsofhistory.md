<p id="title">The Lessons of History - Will and Ariel Durant</p>

An insightful, even poetic high-level overview of human history from many angles. 
Some lines that stood out for me:

"Heaven and utopia are buckets in a well: when one goes down the other goes up; when religion declines Communism grows."

"The only real revolution is in the enlightenment of the mind and the improvement of character, the only real emancipation is individual, and the only real revolutionists are philosophers and saints."

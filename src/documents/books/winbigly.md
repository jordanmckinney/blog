Win Bigly recounts the election of Trump through a "persuasion filter".

Scott argues that (especially) in the realm of politics, the policy and facts don't actually matter.
Humans are not rational with momentary lapses of irrationality, they are irrational with momentary lapses of reason.
The race was never about policy, it was a marketing/persuasion competition (as it always is).
Scott used his persuasion filter to accurately predict not only Trump's victory, but also an eerie number of other moves made by Trump and other candidates.

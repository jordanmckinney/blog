<p id="title">GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach - Douglas Hofstadter</p>

Hofstadter weaves together mathematics, computer science, art, and music into an enigmatic explanation of consciousness as some kind of mind-bending self-referential loop.
I've started the book over twice, taking notes throughout, but have yet to finish. 
However GEB is the strangest, most brilliant thing I've read, so I must include it.

<p id="title">How to Win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie</p>

Carnegie's classic collection of simple lessons for human interaction.
He outlines methods for handling people (don't criticize, give sincere appreciation), how to make people like you (be genuinely interested, smile, use names), how to win people to your way of thinking (avoid argument, admit when you're wrong, let the other person talk), and how to lead.

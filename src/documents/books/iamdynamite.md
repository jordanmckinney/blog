Nietzsche was brilliant, of course.
He was a fiercely independent thinker.
What I love most about him though is that he lived and philosophized with his whole heart.
He wrote once that his eyes were red and swollen from days of crying at the beauty of existence.
Nietzsche for me embodies the life-affirming attitude.

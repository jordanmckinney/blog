<p id="title">Diaspora, Greg Egan</p>

By far the most intense, creative, mind-bending hard sci-fi I've encountered in print, film, or anywhere else. 
I'm still blown away by how "right" Egan gets everything.
Arthur C. Clarke's 2001 has been my model of "accurate", hard sci-fi.
Diaspora is without a doubt the new standard.

The book opens with a flooring, highly detailed, low-level description of the construction/birth of a synthetic mind/AI, the beginning shadows of thought, the bootstrapping of consciousness.

I don't think I can go back to other sci-fi writers...

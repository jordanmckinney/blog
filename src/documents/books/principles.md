<p id="title">Principles, Ray Dalio</p>

Ray Dalio shares his very simple and very general principles that he has developed over many years of running Bridgewater -- one of the most successful hedge funds of all time.

What I find most compelling about Dalio's principles is that they are hyper-rational and hyper-realistic.
He places supreme emphasis on figuring out and accepting whatever is true, and then systematically breaking down the problem and solving it.

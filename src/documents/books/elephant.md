I'm tempted to call this a "must-read".
It looks like a shocking amount of what we do in the world is done for the purpose of signalling to others (often that we are good/loyal people).

We think we go to University to get educated, we think we seek medical care to get well, we think our political decisions are made to better the country.
Hanson/Simler make the case that the real motivation behind these actions is signalling.

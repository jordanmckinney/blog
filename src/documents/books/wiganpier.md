<p id="title">Road to Wigan Pier - George Orwell</p>

The first half is Orwell's recounting of his tour through 1930's Lancashire coal mining towns which will inspire a deep, deep gratitude for the comforts of modern society. 
In the second half Orwell talks about his experiences around class and his arguments for Socialism as well as his honest analysis of the shortcomings of the average Socialist.

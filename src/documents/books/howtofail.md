<p id="title">How to Fail at Everything and Still Win, Scott Adams</p>

Scott has a pretty unique approach to success. 
He makes the case that systems are better than goals, that you need to "allow luck to find you", that you can succeed by being pretty good in a couple select areas (but world class in nothing), that you can re-program yourself to eat well and exercise, that mantras at least _seem_ to work (maybe because we live in a simulation), etc.

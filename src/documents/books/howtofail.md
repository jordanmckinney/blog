<p id="title">How to Fail at Everything and Still Win Big - Scott Adams</p>

Scott has a pretty unique approach to success. 
He makes the case that systems are better than goals, that you need to "allow luck to find you", that you can succeed being pretty good in a couple areas but world-class in nothing, that you can re-program yourself to eat well and exercise, that mantras _seem_ to work, etc.

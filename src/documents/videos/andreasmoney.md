<p id="title">The Killer App: Engineering the Properties of Money, Andreas Antonopoulos</p>

Andreas explains what money is, what functions it serves, and how Bitcoin can not only meet these functions but exceed them and why that matters. Killer talk. Inspired my Medium post [Markets, Money & Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@jordanmmck/markets-money-bitcoin-96e5539bceef).

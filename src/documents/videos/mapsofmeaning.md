<p id="title">Maps of Meaning, Jordan Peterson</p>

For all my life, but the last few years especially, I have held a pretty scientific, skeptical view of the world. Religion, culture, and myth seemed to me nothing but pseudo-random superstition and dead-weight. Peterson has completely altered my thinking on these and many other topics.

Perhaps even more impactful, his views on responsibility and how to live a meaningful life have been deeply clarifying and inspiring.

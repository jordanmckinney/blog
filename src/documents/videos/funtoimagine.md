<p id="title">Fun to Imagine, Richard Feynman</p>

I cannot overstate how impactful these videos have been to my life. I found them several years ago and, along with Feynman's other work, they ignited in me a new appreciation for math, science and nature. Feynman's way of thinking along with Elon Musk's incredible drive and vision were the key factors which inpsired me to go back to school for engineering at 26.

<p id="title">Pay Attention, Jordan Peterson</p>

Peterson tells the Egyptian myth of Osiris, Horus, Isis and Set and explains how the Egyptians were capturing in myth the fundamental ethic by which people should live. A fascinating talk and at 15 minutes I think it is a good introduction to some of Peterson's ideas.

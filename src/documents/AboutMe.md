I am a 4th year Computer Science student at UVIC, currently on co-op at Bambora in Victoria. My main interests are Blockchain technology, Machine Learning, and AI.

I made this site as a place to show projects as well as a place to post writing on various topics. I plan to write posts which assume little or no prior experience in the subject. If I can write a good explanation in that way then it will help me understand the subject.

[Notes](https://github.com/jordanmmck/notes) is an ongoing project intended to function as a sort of memory-extension/learning-accelerator.
The project consists of notes on crypto, economics, finance, science, technology, philosophy, etc.

When learning a new concept I write out a longer-form explanation of it in order to see where my understanding is lacking.
As I come to understand and internalize the concept I condense the writing to note form.
When some topic is well understood the relevant notes are either removed or compressed down to just a few bullets.


Notes uses [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) and can be viewed at [notes.jordanmmck.com](https://notes.jordanmmck.com/).

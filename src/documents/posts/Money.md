<center> <h3>Markets</h3> </center>

One of the great advantages of humans organising themselves into groups was that individuals could specialize. Rather than each group member dividing their time between gathering food, fashioning tools, and every other task necessary to survive, they could specialise in a few, or even one task.

When people were in small groups it was relatively easy for individuals to keep track of how much work the others were doing. If a group member wanted a place in the group, share of the food, shelter etc. they had better contribute. If an individual failed to contribute their peers would notice and they would suffer potentially fatal consequences.

When groups became large enough such that keeping track of an individual's contributions was no longer feasible, intra-group trade became the system for regulating contribution. Rather than anyone keep track of how many shoes the shoemaker has produced, just let him trade shoes for whatever he needs. If he wants food, he better make shoes, if he wants shelter just needs to make more shoes. He is rewarded in proportion to how much the rest of the values his goods or services. Everyone trades their goods or services. This is a market.

Markets are very interesting because they are **emergent 'collective intelligence' systems**. They extract from the minds of the participants the value of goods and services, and they do so without any necessary leader, governing body, or even self awareness. 

If the market really values salt then it will assign a high price to salt. People will then go out and find more salt in proportion to the price. If a lot of salt gets produced then the price will drop and less people will be rushing out to go find salt. Eventually the market allocates just the right amount of human effort to salt procurement.

Incidentally, the market incentivizes all the actions that go along with obtaining more salt. The salt demand may spawn new technologies, cause exploration, or even start wars. But markets have tremendous momentum. If there is demand for some good then the market will summon that good into existence no matter the condequences. Even when participants become aware that the production or extraction of some good is doing immense dmage we have a hell of a time doing anything about it. Market forces are very strong.

So markets allow people to specialize in large societies and respond dynamically to the priorities of the people without organizational overhead. Markets are **decentralised value-signalling and resource-allocating systems**.

The market solution to the large-groups-of-people-specializing problem naturally introduced a bunch of new problems.

How do you keep track of what things are worth? How many chickens is a pair of shoes worth? How many loaves of bread is a metal axe-head worth? 

In order for us to trade we need to have a [coincidence of wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants). If you make shoes, but all the bakers have good shoes already, how do you get your bread? If a baker wants shoes but you don't need any bread then he doesn't get shoes.

Another issue is that most goods or services are not easily divisible. An axe-head may be worth 20 loaves of bread but you can't divide the axe-head. And 20 loaves of bread won't keep before you can eat them all.

Money solves these problems. Historically money actually emerges naturally from existing materials rather than by being introduced 'officially' by a government. A society collectively finds a commodity like gold or silver that is scarce and may or may not have some intrinsic value. Hopefully this material is also easy to transport, durable, and so on and then it can be used as a 'medium of exchange' - as money.

So, what are the functions of money?

The key functions that a form of money should have if it is going to be useful and have staying power are **medium of exhange**, **unit of account**, and **store of value**:

-------------

#### Medium of Exchange

This is the primary job of money and is what makes money _money_. Medium of exchange just means that the money serves as the thing that people trade in place of actual goods. Rather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken. This is a massive gain in terms of ease of trade. To be a good medium of exchange a money should be portable, durable, fungible (any dollar is just as good as any other), scarce, and easily divisible.

#### Unit of Account

This is the ability to say a chicken is worth X dollars, a pair of shoes is worth Y dollars, rather than saying a chicken is worth Z pairs of shoes. So all goods and services are priced in terms of a common measure. This is extremely useful in determining how valuable something is in relation to everything else. You can now do all kinds of accounting and economic analysis.

#### Store of Value

From Wikipedia: "To act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved...". It would be nice if the dollars you earned could be held for a long time and then used later.

-------------

Fiat currencies, which are government backed currencies like the US or Canadian dollar, do a decent job of fulfilling these functions. This is why we use them. That and the fact that in most countries the law states that taxes, wages etc. must be paid in fiat.

It is important to note that fiat currencies are typically not backed by anything. That is, your Canadian dollar or US dollar is not worth X amount of gold, or anything else for that matter, it is just a unit of currency. Modern money has **no intrinsic value whatsoever**, (neither do cryptocurrencies) but as long as enough people agree that it has value then it has value. As people buy into the idea/delusion that money has value they begin to accept it in leiu of goods/services and then it gains *actual* value.

Money has been called 'the bubble that never pops' because it *is* a bubble. The market has assigned great value to something that isn't itself valuable. But the money bubble doesn't pop. It actually gets stronger the more 'delusional' people become.

So fiat is widely used, but isn't actually a perfect medium of exchange. Despite the fact that virtually all our money exists in digital form it is still not easy to send money long distances. Cash works well for in-person exchanges, but sending money across country is costly and difficult, and sending money across borders is slow, difficult and expensive.

Fiat is also a poor store of value. It's inflationary for one, so the 1000 dollars in your bank account loses a little value every day. But it is also attached to the parent country's economy and continued existence. If your country's economy dips so does your money. If your country's banking system acts irresponsibly and causes runaway inflation your money can become worthless.

If you aren't confident about the future of your country then you might change some of your fiat into gold, which is a much better store of value. The gold price is determined partly by how uncertain people feel about the future. The downside to gold is that it is not a very good medium of exchange. Gold is hard to handle and send, hard to divide precisely, and hard to verify in terms purity.

Each of these solutions represent a compromise. Historically we have looked for materials in our environment that have some of the desired properties of a good money, but none have been perfect. We get stuck with whatever other properties the material has. With cryptocurrencies we can now finally _choose_ the properties. We can **engineer money from the ground up**.

An better money would be a great medium of exchange. So, easy and cheap to send, easily divisible, impossible to counterfeit, fungible, perhaps anonymous etc. It would also be a great store of value. So, non-inflationary, easy to store securely, easy to retrieve from storage, and ideally not tied to any government or country. Ideally it would not controlled by any ruling party at all, and would require minimal beauracracy and resources to run.

This is what Bitcoin and others have built. Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world quickly and cheaply. It is easily divisible, impossible to counterfeit, fungible, and under your control (unlike money kept in a bank). It is also decentralised. It has no employees, no CEO or owner, and takes no profits. Nor does it have a location. The network is distributed all around the world.

Bitcoin has a predetermined issuance model, so an ever **decreasing** amount of Bitcoin is created every day, and eventually all production will stop. So Bitcoin is deflationary rather than inflationary. Your savings should at the very least not *lose* value just by sitting in your account. Perhaps most importantly Bitcoin is not tied to any country or government and has no official 'leader' or controlling group. It is decentralised.

We have never been able to engineer money until now. The greatest potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may lie in entirely new, yet undiscovered functions that have never occured to us before. Maybe we want our spending to be private, but government spending to be transparent. Maybe we want our money to be divisible down to a thousandth of a cent for micro transactions. Maybe we want money to be automatically sent to someone if some kind of event happens. New use cases are being thought up every day.

Money is absolutely central to all aspects of society and the strucutre of society itself. The impact of revolutionizing money will no doubt be on the scale of world-altering inventions like the Internet itself.

<center> <h3>Markets</h3> </center>

One of the great advantages of humans organising themselves into groups was that individuals could specialize. Rather than each group member dividing their time between gathering food, fashioning tools, and every other task necessary to survive, they could specialise in a single or a few tasks.

When people were in small groups it was relatively easy to keep track of how much work each individual was doing. If a group member wanted a place in the group, share of the food, shelter etc. they had better contribute. If an individual failed to contribute their peers would notice and they would suffer the (potentially fatal) consequences.

When groups became large enough such that keeping track of an individual's contributions was no longer feasible, intra-group trade became the system for regulating contribution. Rather than keep track of how many shoes the shoemaker has produced, just let him trade shoes for whatever he needs. If he is working hard and contributing a lot then he will get rewarded. Everyone trades their goods or services with every other. This is a market.

Markets are very interesting because they are *emergent 'collective intelligence' systems*. They extract from the minds of the participants the true value of goods and services. If the market really values salt then they will assign a high price to salt. People will then go out and find more salt in proportion to the price. If too much salt gets produced then the price will drop and less people will rush out in search of salt. 

Incidentally, the market unknowingly incentivizes all the actions that go along with obtaining more salt. The salt demand may spawn new technologies, cause exploration, or even start wars. Markets are blind. They don't account for the secondary effects of their demands, even if they are detrimental to the participants.

So markets allow people to specialize in large societies and to respond dynamically to the priorities of the people without any kind of organizational overhead. Markets are **decentralised value-signalling and resource-allocating systems** that require no governing body, though one may be introduced to prevent undesirable behavior like collusion.

This market solution to the large-groups-of-people-specializing problem introduced another problem. How many chickens is a pair of shoes worth? How many loaves of bread is a metal axe head worth? If you make shoes, but all the bakers have good shoes already, how do you get your bread? This is the 'coincidence of wants' problem. I need to want what you have, and you need to want what I have in order for us to trade. 

Another issue is that most goods or services are not easily divisible. An axe head may be worth 20 loaves of bread but you can't divide the axe head. And 20 loaves of bread won't keep before you can eat them all.

Money is the solution to these problems. Historically money actually emerges naturally rather than being introduced by a government as is done today. A society will collectively find a commodity like gold that has some intrinsic value and is perhaps also easy to transport, durable, and so on and they will use it as a 'medium of exchange' - as money.

So, what are the functions of money?

The key functions that a form of money should have if it is going to be useful and have staying power are medium of exhange, unit of account, and store of value:

-------------

#### Medium of Exchange

This is the primary job of money and is what makes money _money_. Medium of exchange just means that the money serves as the thing that people trade in place of actual goods. Rather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken. This is a massive gain in terms of ease of trade. To be a good medium of exchange a money should be portable, durable, fungible (any dollar is just as good as any other), scarce, and easily divisible.

#### Unit of Account

This is the ability to say a chicken is worth X dollars, a pair of shoes is worth Y dollars, rather than saying a chicken is worth Z pairs of shoes. So all goods and services are priced in terms of a common measure. This is extremely useful in determining how valuable something is in relation to something else. You can now do all kinds of accounting and analysis of market activity. 

#### Store of Value

From Wikipedia: "To act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved...". It would be nice if the dollars you earned could be held for a long time and then used later.

-------------

Fiat currencies, which are government backed currencies like the US or Canadian dollar, do a decent job of fulfilling these functions. This is why we use them. That and the fact that in most countries law states that taxes, wages etc. must be paid in fiat.

It is important to note that fiat currencies are typically not backed by anything. That is, your Canadian dollar or US dollar is not worth X amount of gold, or anything else for that matter, it is just one dollar. Modern money has **no intrinsic value whatsoever**, (neither do cryptocurrencies) but if enough people agree that it has value then it has value. This is why money has been called a 'mass delusion', or 'the bubble that never pops'. The delusion works when the money does a good job. The better a particular money does at satisfying the functions of money the 'stronger' it will be.

So fiat is widely used, but isn't actually a perfect medium of exchange. Despite the fact that virtually all our money exists in digital form it is still not easy to send money long distances. For in-person exchanges cash works well, but sending money across the country is not easy and will incur a fee. And sending money to another country is difficult, slow, and very expensive.

Fiat is also a very poor store of value. It's inflationary for one, so the 1000 dollars in your bank account loses a little value every day. But it is also attached to the parent country's economy and continued existence. If your country's economy dips so does your money. If your country's banking system acts irresponsibly and causes runaway inflation your money can become worthless. So if you aren't confident in the future of your country then you might change some of your fiat into gold, which is a much better store of value. The gold price then is determined partly by how uncertain people feel about the future.

The downside of gold is that it is not a very good medium of exchange. Gold is hard to handle and send, hard to divide precisely, and hard to verify in terms purity. Historically we have looked for materials in our envirnment that have some of the desired properties of a good money. But it's always been a compromise. We get stuck with whatever other properties the material has. Well now we can _choose_ the properties. We can engineer money from the ground up.

An ideal money would be a great medium of exchange. So, easy and cheap to send, easily divisible, impossible to counterfeit, fungible, perhaps anonymous etc. It would also be a great store of value. So, non-inflationary, easy to store securely, easy to retrieve from storage, and ideally not tied to any government or country. Even better it would be great if it were not controlled by any government or group at all. That way it cannot easily be manipulated or corrupted.

<center> <h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3> </center>

Bitcoin and others are attempting to build this ideal currency. In their current state they already have some major advantages over fiat. Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It is easily divisible, impossible to counterfeit, fungible, and fairly anonymous.

Bitcoin has a predetermined issuance model, so an ever **decreasing** amount of Bitcoin is created every day, and eventually all production will stop. So Bitcoin is deflationary rather than inflationary. Your savings should at the very least not *lose* value just by sitting in your account. Perhaps most importantly Bitcoin is not tied to any country or government and has no official 'leader' or controlling group. It is decentralised.

We have never been able to truly engineer money until now. The greatest potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may lie in entirely new, yet undiscovered functions that have never occured to us before. Maybe we want our spending to be private, but government spending to be transparent. Maybe we want our money to be divisible down to a thousandth of a cent for micro transactions. Maybe we want money to be automatically sent to someone if some kind of event happens. New use cases are being thought up every day.

Money is absolutely central to almost all aspects of society. If we can revolutionize money the impact will no doubt be on the scale of world-altering inventions like the Internet itself.

[Medium post](https://medium.com/coinmonks/bitcoin-security-in-one-chart-694ee3ed8c2d) plotting Bitcoin "security factor" over time, and extrapolating into the future.

This post, like the previous one, was added to the [Coinmonks](https://medium.com/coinmonks) Medium publication, and it was featured in the [CryptoChat](https://us16.campaign-archive.com/?u=1f5a2ff3f60a10d68aea34a25&id=2344913960) newsletter. 
I also summarized the post via [Tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/jordanmmck/status/1042074859977592833).

`Why?`

Why do this? All the computers in this network are in a race to find this number. And there's no way to do it quickly except try lots of times. A faster computer will do this well, but to have a 50/50 change of *your* block getting in you alone need to represent 50% of the computing power of the entire bitcoin network. So it's a lottery. Roughly speaking each computer has a similar chance of finding the number. So who knows which block is going in next.
This prevents double spending somehow... 

Mining is just a way of having an un-gameable lottery. First one to find the needle in the haystack wins. You literally give them a starting template and saying OK now find some number that you can have in the payload which will make it hash to this super ‘rare’ number of something below 0x0000000000000000000000001000000000000000000 or whatever it is. You do this because you don’t want an attacker to be able to overpower the network. So just by having 1 million dollars of computing power cannot do it. Even 100 million probably is not enough. The more people and independently mining the more power the system has. Then a 51% attack becomes more costly. Bitcoin could have been 51% easily back in the day. I wonder if it just survived on people being cool until it reached some stable size where no one person could very easily over power it. Without spending more than they thought they could steal. 

With PoS computers will still do work for the network, but they won’t do this busy work. That is just a not so great mechanism. Like a crude wheel. 

What a concept PoW is though. The protocol reacts to the computers running it. It really is the first digital organism. Or one of the main ones anyway. It has spread all over. It runs on insane amounts of electricity. It exists in harddrives all over the place, copies of itself millions of times. So the blockchain is like its body. The code for the bitcoin node is like it’s life support, brain, ether, life force. This abstract structure has become alive. No one controls it. It is off the leash. Well the client is controlled. Really the being is born onto the network and it evolves as the coders fix up the brain/nervous system of the thing. It lives, maybe flourishes. It basically roams cyberspace performing some useful task hopefully. Bitcoin is an organism that just keeps a super reliable record for you. A distributed database. This is version 1 of a distributed, trustless, etc database I think. It is the first one that really solved everything that was make or break. If you can make such a database you can do money. Money is just a database. And my god what an expensive database. 

Half a billion per year in electricity just to keep this database running. Jesus. We can do many orders of magnitude better than that. We are going to build distributed messaging. So unstoppable messages. Like firechat. We are of course going to have the world computer. A weird cyber organism/machine that allows arbitrary code to be executed in a trustless way. The EVM. It really is a virtual machine.

IPFS will be a distributed S3 bucket. Content addressable distributed database. Is what I think it is. Then content willl be able to flow freely from node to node. Right now one server may have a file and have to communicate it to 1 million nodes. Bittorrent fixed this somewhat. You pass someone a file which has a list of peers to talk to. But you don’t just trust random peers. So you get a hash list. And check all the blocks as you get them. I suppose you hash each block you get. If it’s on the list it gets saved. If not it gets dropped.

Imagine if 80% of the world’s computation was done by small businesses and individuals. Sure certain things will be living in giant server farms doing special stuff. If golem works maybe even the computing for most big scale things would be distributed. But with all the computers scattered around the world that are idle most of the time, I’m sure we could double the compute power at least. So much redundancy right now. Having some nodes that must try to meet demand for some file that is being requested millions of times is not efficient. Imagine they were like a web. All devices were capable of bouncing arbitrary data around. So all internet traffic could eventually be routed through all devices. Rather than server to server along known paths. Latency would be almost nil. Media would spread like bacteria. Rivers would form. You would have these constant torrents of data flowing from hotspots. They make meandering paths through the world. Some content would flow along certain geographical features. 

This network of nodes will be the new internet. The whole internet. Routing will go through them. Data will be stored on them. And of course computing will be done on them. Golem for distributing computing jobs which hosts will run. Then there is the EVM. Nodes run the ethereum software and become an ethereum node. Ethereum nodes will carry out sensitive code. Code that we can’t just send and hope that it gets picked up. Ethereum really is a paradigm shift. You can create things you fundamentally could not do on the old internet. 

The DAO is the killer app. On IPFS or using golem to send compute jobs around, that doesn’t create life. I mean you sort of have something. You have a pretty dumb system. IPFS would be insanely useful but it doesn’t appear intelligent does it. It’s just a sort of reflexive system. It just allows media circulation. A DAO is different. A DAO is arbitrary machine that is written onto the blockchain. It is built when the smart contract is created. It is born when some gas is sent to it. Then we see how it does. A DAO could provide UBI. You could fuel the DAO and it could intelligently and ungamebly distribute funds. We could use Woah. A DAO could do anything. It could be given access to your cameras, microphones, etc. We can give it limbs. Those limbs can be whatever we want. We can give it actuators. A DAO could one day be running the electrical grid. We could design ones that would simply do the jobs of routing power. We could build intelligent DAOs that use Watson like sentiment analysis to connect depressed people with people who can help them.

When does it makes sense for it to be a dao? Well when you want it autonomous. If someone can control it easily then it’s not very autonomous. And when you want it super robust, unkillable. It could have a swarm brain as well. The core computation would be done on smart contracts, but it could easily ship off arbitrary compute jobs to nodes. It could pay them. It could pay them whatever it wanted to perhaps. If you give a smart contract the right starting conditions and goals can it become intelligent?

Daos will obviously evolve. They will fork, fork, some forks will die. New ones always born. Existing ones being shaped and upgraded. These really are like life. We really are going to build the computer of the world. The world computer. There may be weather daos. There will be many many capital allocator daos. They will trade with each other, fight each other. Eventually an ecosystem emerges. The daos will be different sizes and very different species. Once you open things up to evolution then shit can get real. There will be some spectacular daos. They are going to be the stars of our era I think. 

Dao democracy. Wow world governance can finally be upgraded. We can decide what we want on a personal level, and have it intelligently moved toward. Key word intelligently. And key to ask what people want personally. An angry person may want a certain foreign policy, but really they want to be heard, feel important, feel relevant etc. The feeling gets transformed into political will, but misguided political will. He may demand deporting the mexicans, but it won’t likely fix his problem. 

A democracy dao could find out what people personally want and sum these into weighted actions. These actions could be small and large, perhaps mostly large at first, or imprecise somewhat. People will still be implementing a lot of the changes I think. Tax rates and stuff can be altered quickly. Or UBI rates perhaps is more accurate. 

But the democracy dao could sit sort of at the top, at least at the top of some other daos. For it would supposedly transmit the will of the people to other daos and to the other people... So you outsource a lot of the intelligent thought of people in prediction markets. So the dao figures out what people want? Then other people figure out how to achieve it, by betting on it. 

So someone propses a way to solve some small problem. It’s an open market so anyone can make bets. They place money on idea A doing the trick. Others bet against it. These are votes of course. But not everyone votes on everything. You vote on stuff you feel confident about. And you stake proportional to your confidence. Although more accurately you stake proportional to your ability to stake multiplied by your confidence. Is this not just voting with money? I suppose you have to implement option 1 and 2 in comparable areas or something? 

But you don’t just say option a, b, c, anyone can vote which one is the most likely to raise happiness by 2%  in 1 year. You could try all 3 I suppose. One will likely work better. These need to be very carefully designed.

Though perhaps it would be hard to game. If the dao asks you vague questions about what you want in life, that’s pretty hard to change people’s answers to benefit your company or something.

I could see the dao working because the collective money of the people is quite large. It may be very hard to strong man these. So if a bad guy bets against your idea to the tune of millions of dollars, but then all 3 are executed. Well he has incentive to sabotage your stuff. Though that might be pretty hard to do in practice. He would have a hard time influencing people or rigging systems to lie about outcomes. 

The dao could even allow itself to be amenable by prediction market. This does seem to place a whole lot of faith in prediction markets. You would like veto ability. If an idea is ugly we might not want it. Well the ideas comes from people just proposing them. Smart people. People propose these things and maybe they convince a group of smart people who know the subject matter. Then how do we narrow down the proposed solutions? Perhaps it costs money to propose. Proposing something could give you a stake in it working. You get 5% or something of the payout. The payout comes only from people who bet against it? What a job. To work in the prediction markets. What a fun way to apply your domain knowledge. Make money and help fix things. So if almost everyone agrees I guess the payoff is small. And if there’s uncertainty what to do then that means the problem needs more people/ smarter people. That uncertainty causes people to short stuff and the payoff increases. Man I should short some of the stupid stuff we do. 

This is the greatest form of government I’ve heard of. 

So people need to decide what they want in some kind of secure way. Somehow we need to get some honest sentiment about what’s troubling people. Probably the best way to do this is just observe? Or ask? So you find out people are lonely and scared and insecure and tired and miss their youth. So the dao decides we want to optimize the work week lets say. 

This problem is stated somehow. By people. And it’s made open to proposals. We must just let the market decide on which to bet on. Eventually we see that 80% of the money is on 5 ideas perhaps. So these 5 would be run somehow in equal ways. That is the intervention must be made randomly if possible and spread out so to average out any differences regarding if solA gets tried in one geographic area well who knows why it didn’t work.

Once we figure out how to build a dao to distribute wealth in some kind of intelligent ungameable way, we can bootstrap to UBI. If we could just allow it to start small and spread it could work. Everyone wants the money. So if you can find a way to fund the thing and have reward people based on doing good things. We could solve this. It would need to be impossible to trick. You would get paid based on how much you made right. So it would have to know how much you make. So how can the dao know how much money you got? By your tx’s ofcourse but you could always hide those. You could have a million BTC, how would it know. Maybe by physical good and services. If you lived a certain richness perhaps it gives you little. If you live modestly it gives you some. Some aspects of wealth are tied to the physical world. 

So for daos to thrive we need a platform (ethereum). We need incentive for their code to be run. They pay. That’s easy. Either they self fund or we fund them. I think that’s it. The dna of the dao lives on a blockchain. The ethereum block chain. And these exist as accounts. The accounts are being updated by the blockchain. So any account will have some old tx’s frozen in the blockchain forever. But the account is somehow a present thing. Does the account only consist of it’s history? Do you need to trace back through time to get a picture of the account/smart contract. 

Of course a dao could and would consist of many smart contracts. The individual smart contracts might be more like cells. Or building materials. Wood and nails. Then the dao is the emergent creature.

So the tx record and program code for a dao is stored on a blockchain. A lot of dao management must be done manually by people still. 


China mines like 3/4 of the BTC

~~~ Transactions

The block size is 1MB so that's the max tx's the network can handle, 7 per sec
This is no longer enough, so do we increase block size? Or use side chain?
Transaction fees are essentially a bribe to say 'include my tx in your block!'
It is all just a big transaction chain. There is no sending exactly 10 BTC to someone. If you want to send 10 BTC you either link a previous tx of yours which gave you >10BTC to this new address or you link a bunch of smaller tx's to this new one. Then the tx will have you linking some tx to them and them linking a tx back to you (the change)...?
Each tx has multiple inputs and at most 2 outputs: one for payment and one for returning the change back to sender.
To send 17.1 BTC you take a bunch of tx that total at least 17.1 and you use them as inputs into a new tx. This tx will output 17.1 exactly to the person you want to pay, and another tx back to you with the change. BTC is only split up in tx's. So you can't split an unspent tx that you have from 20 BTC to 10 and 10. Can you not do a tx where both outputs go back to you?
You effectively just change your 1 unspent input into 2 unspent inputs. And the 'breaking change' could be seen and traced backward and all that. But why? It still costs a tx. So it makes no sense to take up block space and time breaking change *then* doing the tx. There's no point.
If things just kept splitting then you would end up with trillions of satoshies going around clogging up the blocks. But every tx has at most 2 outputs. So each tx consolidates BTC. You could have unspent tx of 100000BTC. That's all them BTC in one 'place'.

So you have all these nodes out there all trying to make the next block. They sit on their tx list and start incrementing their nonce seeing if it hashes to a low enough value. It's a lottery weighted by work. So your chance of getting your block in is proportional to your computing power. But to win a lot you would need more computing power than most of the entire network. So it's a lottery. If you fake a block, you might win the lottery. But probably not. You could fake every block. Eventually you get one but other nodes are going to see the error and correct it? Remember all nodes are in consensus about the current block chain. So it is only the next tx that is being built.

Suppose you fired off 2 tx from the same address to two different addresses from opposite ends of the globe. Different tx's propagate. Half the world thinks one tx is legit. The other things the other one is legit. If someone wins the block with no other node also winning nearby (temporally), then that chain gets built on and your other tx shows up later and it not valid. If it is temporally close then you might get a temp fork. But the chance of them continually being close in time such that no single chain convinces more nodes is very small. If propagation speeds were faster we could have shorter block time perhaps. 10 minutes keeps the block chain honest. It seems to me it would be nice to have these hyper parameters somehow controlled by a mathematical device. Like a variable block time that was somehow calculated based on some known values.

Each miner checks each block for validitiy.

1. Check that the previous block exists and is valid.
2. Check that timestamp is greater than parent block. And less than 2 hours in future. ????
3. Check that proof of work is valid (hashes are legit)
4. Check each tx to make sure people are spending values they have, not creating btc out of nothing. If any are not valid reject the whole block. I hope they just reject this tx? OR the whole block then wait until someone else mines it?

You can send tx to yourself.

~~~ Stats
Each block is double sha256 hashed. And must be less than something like 2^187. Takes about 2^69 tries for the network to guess. The limit is re calculated every 2016 blocks to make things harder or not. 201.6 minutes. So many times a day it reacts. Each miner gets 12.5 BTC right now.

The genesis state contained no coins. They were all made by mining. If a tx has a higher input amount than output amount that is a fee that the miner takes. They must edit the tx such that unspent parts go straight to miner's address. So really every tx will have 2 outputs. Unless there is an exact output equals input. 

~~~ Send 'false' btc
1. send 100 btc to store, get digital good
2. make another tx where you send the 100 btc to yourself
3. try to convince network that you sent it to yourself first, so the other one is invalid but you already got the good

To do this successfully the attacker needs 51% of the comp power because they must race the rest of the network. If they can outpace their chain will be taken as truth. Else it won't. These chains could carry on in parallel for ages if necessary. The attacker just keeps building his chain. New nodes just see which is longest. However the reward to mine might be greater than doing this. You also undermine the very system if you do so. Making your BTC probably worthless pretty quick. 

The merkle tree is necessary to compress the data. The whole blockchain is like 30 GB. Due to the 1 MB block size limit the chain can grow at a max 52.5 GB per year. Not much. We could easily store this forever. But Eventually you won't be able to get a damn tx in.

BTC is a system whose rules inside of the very system are what keep the system alive. 

What bitcoin tries to prove to the user is that the past is solidified and certain, the future is as close to certain as we can get. You can’t prove events in the future. But you can design a system that functions properly so long as something remains true which we are really sure will remain true. People like money. So we can be pretty sure that bitcoin will continue to function in the future. PoS attempts to get the same kind of reassurances about the future of the system. Could we ever design the system to somehow rely on something like a law of physics? The thing is is you need consensus. 

What is money?

Money is defined by having the following properties. 

Medium of exchange
You don’t want to trade 1 loaf of bread for 1/20 of a shoe or something. You need a medium to trade in that goods and services can plug into. 
Measure of value 
We need to be able to say that car is worth X units of C, and that house is worth Y units of C.
Store of value
The thing must be able to hold value and then be liquid when we need it. 

Money must also be fungible, divisible, preferably anonymous, hard to steal, easy to spend, etc.

So gold is good at storing value perhaps, but not great for medium of exchange because it’s heavy all hard to divide up. 

Fiat is good at most of these things except not always easy to send, can be hyperinflated by irresponsible governments, is inflationary so not a good store of value.

Bitcoin can solve these requirements better by far than fiat.

Bitcoin keeps a record of transactions and uses math to ensure that the record hasn’t been altered, and economics to ensure that the system continues to keep accurate records. 

So bitcoin is essentially a distributed database. It has a 1/600 Hz clock speed and updates the database on those intervals. The database here is a ledger of values being passed around. 

OK so that’s great! We now have immutable databases at our disposal. Let’s go build stuff. Then people came up with other things besides databases. But to do each new thing required a whole new system to be constructed. Including a new blockchain, new currency etc. 

The blockchain itself does not hold the state of the system. Otherwise it would all have to be 1MB. If every address were on there then 1MB would limit you quite a lot. Instead the only way to get a complete view of the state is to build the state from the genesis block onward. So you would start to build a list of accounts and as visited new blocks you would build up this set of accounts. There might be several gigabytes of account with balances. For bitcoin 1MB of changes can happen per 10 minutes. 

This obviously limits the tx's per second. But what is actually important to this system is the state, not the block size for example. This system is good so long as it's state can be trusted and considered well used and secure and all that.

Mining

If I give you a number 0x000100000 and say you must find a number less than that. What I am saying is play the lottery as many times as you need to until you find a random number that collides with some subset of numbers in 0x0000fffff. 4 leading zeros. There are obviously more numbers in the no-win set. If there were the same number of slots in the win camp and lose camp it would take on average 2.

How many tries does it take on average to get heads on a coin toss?
1 try -> 1/2 the time
2 try -> 1/4 the time
3 try -> 1/8 the time
4 try -> 1/16 the time
So the avg times taken to flip heads it 1/2+1/2+3/8+4/16+5/32+6/64...
This approaches 2.

Another way to look at it is paint a small circle on a large flat surface. Then we randomly place dots on the board until a dot lands inside that random circle. The board size is the search space. Which is 2^256. The size of the circle is the target. Which on such a huge space can also be very huge without it becoming easy to find a collision.

"Bitcoin uses incentives defined inside of a system in order to protect & secure that system's ongoing existence." - @VitalikButerin. Woah.

At the heart of it you decide what kinds of behavior gets you closer to what you want, and reward that. Decide what kind of behavior gets you further from what you want and penalize that. You do this with the cryptocurrency inside the system. So you need some way of knowing for sure when participants *are* doing those good things. 

The machine economy. Digital currency will allow us to build AIs/APIs/machines that function just like agents in an economy. Except that we can program their behavior. They will be able to form markets and bid up/down for various services/exchanges of info. What if someone builds an agent who gains huge amounts of ether/bitcoin but never shares it with any people? Could we have a billionaire AI that just hoards the money? That would be a problem.

Internet of things. Billions/trillions of devices could be made to function in this economy of machines. What a frightening thing. How might this economy evolve? What happens when some entities have huge amounts of money? They still have goals right? So might they use their money to achieve their goals?

A m2m economy could greatly improve the efficiency of the system. Our money system has made our economy millions of times more efficient. We have been able to reward the most useful parties and drive development/research/effort in directions the market likes.

We are essentially opening up our economy to non-human agents for the first time. Currently we have atms which dispense cash without a human watching, but the atm is not an agent in that it is completely passive. The m2m economy will still have passive machines, but it will also have billions of new entities which bid, watch market prices, make decisions.

Our economy will become machine dominated. What does that look like? Surely it will become dominated by machines. Machines will become the dominant actors in this economy. Perhaps their accounts will be owned by their human creators. The agent will use some percentage of its money to make more money and the human will take and use whatever is necessary. Even better the machine will intelligently use the funds so to risk 1% of the funds it will only require a certain probability of return, to risk 100% of funds it will require a 100% certainty of return.

The human creator will withdraw money from this active account as he sees fit. So anything he doesn't want to risk losing should be withdrawn from the main account.

The most successful agents in this economy will be those that trade with other AI agents. These trades can happen on a vastly differnt time scale. Trading with humans will always be slower. Ideally the humans eventually stop actually trading directly with this economy. Agents will sit between the human and the market. So the human decides what they want and the agents make trades based on this. No matter what your goal is it would never be beneficial for you to trade directly. So we will have a layer of agents running the economy and we will sit on top of this layer dictating to the agents what they should do with our money, or rather what we desire.

This new economy will quickly become too complicated for humans to comprehend so we really won't have any choice but to let the machines run the thing.

Of course until we are close to strong AI people will be the ones creating the agents. Though we can also leverage evolutionary principles to evolve the agents that we want.

In this new arena in life, what are the pressures? Well we can always expect a cost for running computation. So that is the 'food/energy' of this new life. So agents should evolve to be lean in this regard. For this to work we need the agents to be able to modify their code. Really we will be doing that. Random mutation doesn't work because the code of today doesn't run at all given a small error. The blocks of evolution will have to be larger chunks if we are going to have anything like that. At first anyway it will be the human programmer making code changes. 

Perhaps the machines could tweak some hyperparameters and use something like gradient descent to find the best settings.

So the pressure will be to reduce the size of the agent, reduce the computational steps, maximize the money earned. These are the evolutionary pressures in this space. In nature energy is free in a sense, so nature can try lots of different things and it doesn't have any external cost. In this realm random experimentation costs money to do. Money that would otherwise go to some person. So there shuold be some balanced level of evolutionary experimentation going on. 

So generate a key pair. The public key is your addresss. The private key is your private key. Do we really not even check if the address is in use? The address space must be freaking huge. This explains that site where it shows 'all' the public and private key pairs. Really it just generates a page of them... No one knows which public keys will get used until they show up in a tx.
I think you generate your address from your private key. You obviously can't generate a private key from the address or else people could just make a key and take you money. Then you could generate 'all' the private keys in order. 0x00......000 etc. Each time you would get an essentially random number in a truly massive search space. So while this key does give you access to the account you generate, the chance of you generating an account that is in use is actually astronomically small.

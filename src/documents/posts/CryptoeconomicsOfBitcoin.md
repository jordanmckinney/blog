<center><h2>Cryptoeconomics of Bitcoin</h2></center>


The brilliant thing about bitcoin is computing power is what you need to overpower it, but also what you need to profit from it. So most attackers will decide to just mine btc rather than use their compute to destroy it. This is the insight of a crpyo. If you don't actually give them money, give them crypto bucks. Give them tokens. Then undermining it becomes even less tempting. Unless you do a big heist and change all your tokens really quick and run off, it's better to keep the system healthy.

So by given agents tokens in your system, you give them some incentive right away to keep it running. The token aren't worth anything in themselves. So if you want your money to not evaporate you want the system which holds your money to be healthy. At the very least this system should have a way to keep track of who owns what tokens. Or else it is truly worthless to everyone. This really is the simplest case. Bitcoin. All it does is keep track of tokens. That's a good enough service to warrant 600M in mining power.

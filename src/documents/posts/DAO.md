In progress...

At a large scale humans are a swarm of very similar animals. Just like we can take a herd of cows and we have learned some simple rules that apply to basically all cows. Even though each cow is unique. We know the tricks to get them behave how we want.

Humans are just a big swarm as well. From high up we look as similar to each other as one bee does to another. The bulk 99% of humans and their activity are very easy to figure out.

When we have a political system or old fashion system that attempts to control from the outside, what I mean is to make laws, to make systems like representative democracy and then rely on that system to keep things running well, you always have the risk of people subverting your system. If the desires of individual is contrary to the system then the people will find leaks. They will find ways of cheating, subverting, poisoning etc. You can bank on the fact that people will really want to go toward their incentives. Systems like democracy are somewhat fragile then. The ultimate system would be one where the most fundamental of drives within people were somehow aligned with the system so people at their worst would pose no risk at all to the system and nice functioning of society.

What do we want from a system? We basically want Maslow's hierarchy of needs in that order. So we want a safe stable society free from violence and with plenty of food and water and things to do and so on.

If you could align incentives so that we could monetarily incent the behaviors of people that most benefitted the most people. So if we could made the 'greediest' people desperate to increase education standards, or if we could make the most driven companies racing to improve water quality, or media companies racing to bring the discourse to an intellectually honest and thorough thoughtful discussion with no partisan bullshit or fear mongering. If we could do that then we would be in the tractor field of a very strong magnet that would bring us way up. 

Perhaps we can do this with a DAO.

We know damn well that communism and the like is not only not reachable even for a short time, but it's also unstable. It's like a ball on a big convex surface. A little push is enough to bring it down. What you want in a system is one that is like a ball in a concave surface. Big events don't shake it out. A huge terrorist attack doesn't even mess up the system. People continue on quite well. Our system is pretty good but somewhere between these. Terrorism and greed has already caused great decay in US. A big event could actually break their system. And set them back.

*Cryptoeconomics*

What is bitcoin and others doing? The network in operation offers something useful and it uses its usefulness to bribe people into keeping it running. The bitcoin animal bribes users with tokens if they will do the task of keeping the token machine running. You could imagine a monster that wants to produce poison but can't do anything on it's own really, so it bribes people to do its bidding. Ultimately the people produce the poison but the monster had been paying them to do the tasks and so no one had to worry about what they were contributing to. Everyone could just carry on in their best interest. And if the system was a good one, then that is a good thing. If not, then obv bad thing. This has been happening for ages. The oil system can be viewed as such a monster. It bribes us with convenient energy. The catch is that we have to dig up and foul chunks of the Earth and fuck up our climate. The difference is now we can potentially design one to our liking. So far we've been at the mercy of these things. The economy itself is one big monster. 

So it's an exchange. The network does some task for us, or produces something, and we trade with it. We take the product or use the tool, and in exchange we give it our computing power, so the fuel for it to run. But not necessarily only that. We may use our compute to run it's logic, it's brain, but it may also have arms. It may want to move thing. It may want to build something in that spot, it might want to execute certain hard feats of computation and so come up with a bunch of batch style problems that it can distribute out. Maybe not a great example. Well it's all brain. It is just a brain that can 'grow arms' if it incentives something stronly enough. If the bitcoin network was autonomous in some sense it could pay nodes in bitcoin for doing something. But that kind of thing would have to be programmed in. Things don't evolve on the blockchain 'naturally'. Like they don't freely move around there. They don't mate. But DAOs (agents) live and die. Blockchains (the ecosystem) live and die.

But we could program a DAO to pay people to do things in the world. The hard part is how does the DAO *see*. It can't see out into the world. It can't know who to pay the btc to. The blockchain is the great harddrive in the sky. We can see it. Now we need it to be able to see us. This seems necessary. DAOs just need to be able to see. Then we could start affecting directly the world of atoms. Then we could easily correct the whole system. If you can know who did what, if you can see into the world. Then we can say deduct btc from a person whom tries to over power others, or profit from someone's suffering. We can say give btc to people who genuinely help others. People who are honest.

Prediction markets perhaps help a DAO to see. Could we have prediction market for the past? Right now the blockchain is this database that allows us to freeze a record of time. We can put stuff in there and it sticks. If we could let the blockchain 'see' the earth below it we could start going through things that have already happened, like who owns this house, and we could enscribe those into the marble of the blockchain.

How would that even work? You could offer a small amount for a first answer, or broad answer, and there could be an increasing bounty on refining the answer. So it would get bid up. Then it would become very difficult to profit from that particular line. But only after the answer was basically as accurate as we can hope to get. This should self assemble into an accurate view of things. The real tough part is you need some way of saying, 'OK yes this correction that I've just recvd is in fact an improvement and not a decline in accuracy. To do that don't you need to know the truth? Where the target is. Can we gradient descent without a known target? Yes of course, we just use our fitness function. So we don't know the truth ahead of time. But we know when we are getting warmer. How could you do that in code?

We need a fitness function. The nodes have to somehow come together to choose up or down. More truthy or more falsey. Surely we can do that. How do you get a bunch of nodes to tell if one statement is more true than another?

This could be the ultimate map of truth. This could the next step in the idea of gathering knowledge. Right now they are all in separate books. Some never get the love they deserve. Imagine we had this giant 3D landscape that we started building. This thing would be humanities representation of truh. So it could span all topics. 

So nodes can submit improvements to any statement. These would be perhaps complete. We still need some way for a network to arrive at the truth. 

So how can we ensure 3 people all tell the truth about something. But we don't know what the subject is or anything. It could be something some people want to protect, or stop, or game in any way. So each agent may lie to me intentionally. Each agent may or may not actually know the truth. Agents may be able to coordinate. But probably not all of them coordinate.

So what are the peices in this apparatus? Well it needs to get questions from somewhere. These are the seeds perhaps. Then it needs to accept guesses from nodes. So let the nodes explore this 3D spaceship of any object. Let them start constructing this giant truth scuplture. So each node can cling onto its surface and start building a branch. Well wait wait. To build this artefact we need to printer head working. We need to worry about just determining if one statement is more true than another. So this turing machine head would obv be software so it can exist many times. But these heads would all simulataneaouly be verifying different parts of this truth structure. And they would just do their simple job. They take in two statements and decide which is truer. Or more likely truer.

Questions, 
Do we want to be doing this at the statement level?
What is the right mix of granularity and clock speed?

The best part is that AI can play this game too. So AI can make money by submitting answers. So AI agents will kick ass on these markets eventually. They will atleast do the easy stuff first. They can work for a thousandth of a penny and still be worth their electricity and dev cost. Then humans can point their attention to where the AIs have given up. We really must make sure it's not gamebable. A bunch of AIs could probably figure out how to coordinate with other nodes pretty quickyl and do some weird system where they make more money. But this is solvable.

So what is our machine?

We have an oracle. The oracle can be used to build a truth structure. The oracle is made out of a market. The lives on ethereum obv. The market gets chunks of text fed in. The markets job is to identify the truer one. But is this how we want an oracle to act? Well the problem with truth is you can't really say is this statement true or fasle. Statements can be somewhat true. Inaccurate. So again, start with a bunch of lies, then alter it. Replace a sentence with a shorter one. Whipeout a whole paragraph? At the heart of it it's binary though. A ammendment is either better or worse. The market can bet on that.

A better and better approximation of the truth. That is what we could build. And we could extend branches outward on whatever topics we wanted. It would be a market of course. 

So in even submitting the first seed there should be some reward if it is pretty accurate. Maybe you get more money the slower ammendments come in. IF all the submissions are actually less true than the one we have then we pay out a bit more to the seed. If the seed gets toppled very quickly the seeder should get little. Maybe pay penalty? There must be cost actually to submitting. Else DDoS.

Well actually someone has to be paying for the answer. The submitter must also bet on the quality of their submissions. Then the network participants can start betting. They are betting on which answer everyone else will think everyone else will choose. Is that the truth? Does that system produce the truth? Is it better than chance at finding the truth? Well yes. But then what? A time limit? If the market goes 100 eth on A and 10 eth on B, but really B is true but is just counter intuitive or something, then B will prevail. It's not quite the same as futarchy. In futarchy the world is our oracle. Easy. Just see what happens and use some trusted source. Here we aim to make an active eye. And the problem is it is very course. A prediction market is not general. A prediction market uses wisdom of the crowd but in a limited way. How can we make a general human computer. A human powered computer. Look at all the brains out there. This computer could process sentences like a human, since it is made of people. Every thought must be thought up by a person. 

This really is like building a God. A person of sorts. The prediction market aims to forecast the future. So 'tell the truth' about the future. Or get the human collectives best estimate of the future. To tune the human collective to become a better predictor than any one person. But if we could know in all directions. IF we could look forward and backward in time then we can do anything. If this god like meta being could see into the future reasonably well and simulataneaouly see into the very near past, the longer past etc. It could be used to completely align each agents behaviors. 

The god is the body, which is made of people. The brain which is made of wisdom of the crowd for the future stuff, so human thought, as well as AI. There is this placid body in the sky. Right now we are building it's memory. That is the blockchain. Ethereum serves as the raw material and energy source with which to build this new god. We use ethereum to build this thing. The blockchain glues it together to allow it to have persistent shape. Right now the computtions it is doing are laughably simple. IT just updates a ledger. And other stuff I suppose. Well now it has general memory. And ethereum gives a way for nodes to do arbitrary actions when it comes to updating the ethereum state. But we still have to build. It will need eyes.

Could you just ask the prediciton market anything? Just any question. And your answer may or may not be right. But should be right. Like, is this paragraph true. You shuold be able to ask anything. Even not binary output question? Sure of course. It should be possible to have any type of input or question. But the yes no will perhaps be favored? They are easier to answer. They can be answered quicker. And they *converge*. Give me the best paragraph about how Napolean died doesn't converge really. Or, just not as easily. There could be 100 different submissions and who knows what kind of betting. The market would just pick one. Maybe not the truest. So you could offer up any question. If binary, then cheaper. If complicated then more expensive if you want input and less certain. Both less betters and more outcomes.

This shuold take care of itself. Accept any questions.

Implementation:

*Seeder*
So this agent submits an answer to a question. They have to bet some money on their answer not being overturned very quickly. But submitting an answer is the same as submitting the question of is this a good answer to this question. So we don't need seperate ammender.

*Better*
This agent, the market, then puts money on an outcome. They are not betting on what is true. They are betting on what the market will pick. We need some kind of long term payoff if you bet on something long term being true. Then if it is found out to be true much later you get a greater payout. The question is, what kind of staying power does this prediction have. But then when everyone disagrees and the market chooses the other and you lose your monye? Then there should be some way of ensuring an even greater payout for you when months/years later the market realises the truth. This is tough though because 'the truth' is so hard. I suppose though the truth state of this sytem is a series of binary decisions between statements. So you could go back and find the new accurate branch and pay those betters out. 

So this is a tree. Each decision that was made by the market represents a branch. They could have chosen left but choose right. And so the path went down rightward.

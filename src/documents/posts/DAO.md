In progress...

At a large scale humans are a swarm of very similar animals. Just like we can take a herd of cows and we have learned some simple rules that apply to basically all cows. Even though each cow is unique. We know the tricks to get them behave how we want.

Humans are just a big swarm as well. From high up we look as similar to each other as one bee does to another. The bulk 99% of humans and their activity are very easy to figure out.

When we have a political system or old fashion system that attempts to control from the outside, what I mean is to make laws, to make systems like representative democracy and then rely on that system to keep things running well, you always have the risk of people subverting your system. If the desires of individual is contrary to the system then the people will find leaks. They will find ways of cheating, subverting, poisoning etc. You can bank on the fact that people will really want to go toward their incentives. Systems like democracy are somewhat fragile then. The ultimate system would be one where the most fundamental of drives within people were somehow aligned with the system so people at their worst would pose no risk at all to the system and nice functioning of society.

What do we want from a system? We basically want Maslow's hierarchy of needs in that order. So we want a safe stable society free from violence and with plenty of food and water and things to do and so on.

If you could align incentives so that we could monetarily incent the behaviors of people that most benefitted the most people. So if we could made the 'greediest' people desperate to increase education standards, or if we could make the most driven companies racing to improve water quality, or media companies racing to bring the discourse to an intellectually honest and thorough thoughtful discussion with no partisan bullshit or fear mongering. If we could do that then we would be in the tractor field of a very strong magnet that would bring us way up. 

Perhaps we can do this with a DAO.

We know damn well that communism and the like is not only not reachable even for a short time, but it's also unstable. It's like a ball on a big convex surface. A little push is enough to bring it down. What you want in a system is one that is like a ball in a concave surface. Big events don't shake it out. A huge terrorist attack doesn't even mess up the system. People continue on quite well. Our system is pretty good but somewhere between these. Terrorism and greed has already caused great decay in US. A big event could actually break their system. And set them back.

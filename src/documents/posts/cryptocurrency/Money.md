<center> <h2>Markets, Money & Bitcoin</h2> </center>

People often make the claim that Bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies are ‘not money’. Bitcoin has no physical counterpart, no central bank, and no government backing. You can’t pay your taxes in Bitcoin, nor can you spend it at Wal-mart. So maybe it isn’t money. Well, what is money? What gives money value?

To understand money we need to understand how it started, and what functions it serves.

<center> <h3>Markets</h3> </center>

One of the great advantages of humans organising themselves into groups is specialisation. Rather than each group member dividing their time between gathering food, mending clothing, fashioning tools, and every other task necessary for survival, they could specialise in a few, or even a single task. This provides huge efficiency gains, facilitates technological progress and is generally a good thing.

When people were in small groups it was relatively easy to keep track of how much work others were doing. If a group member was to share in the food, shelter, and safety of the group, they had better contribute. An individual who failed to contribute would soon be found out and would suffer potentially fatal consequences.

This system of sharing while keeping an eye on individual contribution does not scale though. In order for large-scale societies to form humans would need a new system. Trade came to fill this need.

Trade became, among other things, a system for monitoring contribution. Rather than anyone keep track of how many shoes the shoemaker has produced, just let him exchange shoes for whatever he needs. If he wants food he better make shoes, if he wants shelter he just need make more, or higher quality, shoes. If he doesn’t produce then he will not engage in exchange and will simply go without. So the system automatically rewards those who add value and punishes those who do not. This is a market.

Markets are very interesting because they are emergent collective intelligence systems. They extract from the minds of the participants the value of goods and services, and they do so without any necessary leader or governing body. Participants don’t even need to be aware of the concept of a market in order for it to function.

If a market really values salt, then it will assign a high price to salt. People will then go out and find more salt in proportion to the price. If salt demand drops, so does the price, and then fewer people go out to mine it. The market allocates the ‘correct’ amount of human effort to salt procurement.

The market also indirectly incentivises whatever goes along with obtaining more salt. Salt demand may spawn new technologies, spur exploration, even start wars. But market forces are incredibly powerful. If production of some good causes immense environmental harm, or goes against the wishes of a government, but the market demands it, then it will be produced.

So markets allow people to specialise in large societies and respond dynamically to the priorities of people without organisational overhead. Markets are decentralised, value-signalling, resource-allocating systems.

But the market solution to the large-groups-of-people-specialising problem introduced a bunch of new problems.

How do you keep track of what things are worth? How many chickens is a pair of shoes worth? How many loaves of bread is a metal axe-head worth? Trying to keep track of all these conversions quickly becomes infeasible.

Figuring out conversion aside, in order for us to trade we need to have a coincidence of wants. If you make shoes, but all the bakers have good shoes already, how do you get your bread? If a baker wants shoes but you don’t need any bread then he better find another shoemaker who does.

Another issue is that most goods or services are not easily divisible. An axe-head may be worth 20 loaves of bread but you can’t divide the axe-head. And 20 loaves of bread won’t keep before you can eat them all.

Money solves these problems. Historically money actually emerges within a market naturally rather than being introduced by a government. The participants increasingly use some convenient commodity like gold or silver that is already valued in the market as a general stand-in for value. Gold and silver have been historically dominant in filling this niche, but people have used shells, stone carvings, beads and many other materials as money.

The specific material used to play the role of money isn’t actually that important. And in fact, using a material that has some intrinsic value (outside of being money) can actually be problematic. If you use silver coins, but the price of silver goes up above the value of the coin, then people will just use the coins as bullion and destroy your money supply. When choosing a money, or ‘medium of exchange’, what matters is that it fulfils the functions we desire from money, and that people trust it.

So, what are the functions of money?

The key functions that a form of money should have if it is going to be useful and have staying power are medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value:

*Medium of Exchange*

This is the primary job of money and is what makes money, money. Medium of Exchange just means that the money serves as the thing that people trade in place of actual goods. Rather than trading a pair of shoes for a chicken, you trade some money for the chicken. This is a massive gain in terms of ease-of-trade. To be a good medium of exchange a money should be portable, durable, fungible (any dollar is just as good as any other), scarce, and easily divisible.

*Unit of Account*

This is the ability to say a chicken is worth X dollars, a pair of shoes is worth Y dollars, rather than saying a chicken is worth Z pairs of shoes. So all goods and services are priced in terms of a common measure. This is extremely useful in determining how valuable something is in relation to everything else. You can now do all kinds of accounting and economic analysis.

*Store of Value*

From Wikipedia:

To act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved…

It would be nice if the dollars you earned could be held for a long time and then used later.

Fiat currencies, which are government-backed currencies like the US or Canadian dollar, do a decent job of fulfilling these functions. This is why we use them. That, and the fact that in most countries the law states that taxes, wages etc. must be paid in fiat.

It is important to note that fiat currencies are typically not backed by anything. That is, your Canadian dollar or US dollar is not worth X amount of gold, or anything else for that matter, it is just a unit of currency. Modern money has no intrinsic value whatsoever, and neither do cryptocurrencies, but as long as enough people agree that a money has value, then it has value. As people buy into the idea/delusion that money has value they increasingly accept it in lieu of goods or services and it gains actual value. Money has value to the degree that people believe in it.

Money has been called ‘the bubble that never pops’ because it is a bubble. The market has assigned great value to something that isn’t intrinsically valuable. But the money bubble doesn’t pop. It actually gets stronger the more ‘delusional’ people become.

So fiat is widely used, but isn’t actually a perfect medium of exchange. Despite the fact that virtually all our money exists in digital form it is still not easy to send money long distances. Cash works well for in-person exchanges, but sending money across country is costly and difficult, and sending money across borders is slow, expensive, and even more complicated.

Fiat is also a poor store of value. It’s inflationary for one, so the 1000 dollars in your bank account loses a little value every day. But it is also attached to the parent country’s economy and continued existence. If your country’s economy dips so does your money. If your country’s banking system irresponsibly causes runaway inflation (which has happened many times) your money can become worthless.

If you aren’t confident about the future of your country then you might change some of your fiat into gold, which is a much better store of value. The downside to gold is that it is not a very good medium of exchange. Gold is hard to handle and send, hard to divide precisely, and hard to verify in terms purity.

e solutions represent a compromise. Historically we have looked for materials in our environment that have some of the desired properties of a good money, but none have been perfect. We get stuck with whatever other properties the material has. Gold is heavy. Paper money doesn’t have ‘enforced’ scarcity since governments can print as much as they want. With cryptocurrencies we can now finally choose the properties of money. We can engineer money from the ground up.

A superior money would be a great Medium of Exchange. Easy and cheap to send, easily divisible, impossible to counterfeit, fungible, perhaps anonymous etc. It would be a great Store of Value. Non-inflationary, easy to store securely and easy to retrieve from storage. Ideally it would also be independent from any government or country. Even better, it would not be under the control of any ruling party at all, and would require minimal bureaucracy and resources to maintain.

This is what Bitcoin and others have built. Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world quickly and cheaply. It is easily divisible, nearly impossible to counterfeit, fungible, and truly under your control (unlike money in a bank). It is also decentralised. Bitcoin has no employees, no CEO or owner, and takes no profits. Nor does it have a location. The Bitcoin network is distributed all around the world.

Bitcoin has a predetermined issuance model, so an ever decreasing amount of Bitcoin is created every day, and eventually all production will stop. So Bitcoin is deflationary rather than inflationary. This makes it a potentially far superior Store of Value over fiat, and even gold.

We have never been able to engineer money until now. The greatest potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may lie in entirely new, yet undiscovered functions that just haven’t occurred to us yet. Maybe we want our spending to be private, but government spending to be transparent. Maybe we want our money to be divisible down to a thousandth of a cent for micro transactions. Maybe we want money to be automatically sent somewhere in the case of some event. New use cases are being thought up every day.

The strongest case perhaps for the adoption of cryptocurrencies, and their developing useful features, is that we now have a global market for money itself. The same all-powerful market forces that were mentioned above will shape our future money and drive adoption. The best currencies will evolve like organisms and become stronger, while fiat will remain static.

Money is absolutely central to all aspects of human society and largely determines the very structure of society itself. The impact of engineering and revolutionising money will be unlike anything we have seen before.

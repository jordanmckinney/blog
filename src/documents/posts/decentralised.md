Imagine self-owning, self-operating, self-driving cars. You could have a car that is literally owned by itself, or rather it is owned by some DApp on the blockchain. It could decide what to charge for its services, it could even make a profit. Perhaps it would make enough profit to expand its operations until it was able to satisfy demand. 

Maybe it would invest its profits with a decentralised trading AI that needs capital. A decentralised trading agent could similarly earn profits and re-invest. What would it do with all that money though? Likely it would just payout to whoever created it.

The current internet: thin protocols and fat client.
Future internet: Fat protocols and thin clients. 

There will be a lot of resistance from existing power structures because they are going to be shoved into the meritocracy and that sucks if you are privileged.

We will never see another elite president like Clinton or Bush. Itâ€™s all Trumps and Sanders from here on out.

Blockchains and decentralization are important because it allows for permissionless innovation. Historically you had to wait for people to die to innovate because they blocked you.

Perhaps violence will be replaced with forking. Instead of having to resolve conflicts, you just fork.

One of the best things about crypto is its not geographically centralized in San Francisco, that is a strong sign of decentralization.

Nation States will be forced to choose between regulating and getting more innovation.

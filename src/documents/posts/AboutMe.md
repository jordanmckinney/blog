I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at UVIC, and part-time researcher at [Storecoin](http://storeco.in/).
I've done web development coops at [Redbrick](https://rdbrck.com/) and [Bambora](https://www.bambora.com/en/us/).

I write [blog posts](https://medium.com/@jordanmmck) and make [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/Brock34Landers) on the subject of cryptocurrencies, and I run a [Slack channel](https://vicblockchain.now.sh/) called VicBlockchain where we discuss all things crypto, organize meetups, etc.

After graduating in December I hope to work as an ethereum developer.
I can be reached at [jordanmmck@gmail.com](mailto:jordanmmck@gmail.com).

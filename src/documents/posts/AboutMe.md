I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at UVIC.
I've worked for 1 year as a web developer co-op (4 months at [Redbrick](https://rdbrck.com/), 8 months at [Bambora](https://www.bambora.com/en/us/)).

I write blog posts and make YouTube videos on the subject of cryptocurrencies, and I run a Slack channel called VicBlockchain where we discuss all things crypto, organize meetups, etc.

After finishing my degree this December I plan to move into crypto investing.

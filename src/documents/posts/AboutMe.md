I am a 4th year Computer Science student at UVIC. I recently finished an 8 month co-op at Bambora in Victoria, and am returning to UVIC for the fall semester. My main interest is in blockchain technology, especially Ethereum.

I made this site to serve as a project showcase, but also as a place for me to collect some of my favourite books, videos etc.

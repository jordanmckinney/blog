I'm a recent CS grad working on blockchain applications for the music industry at Membran Labs in Victoria.
I've worked as a part-time crypto researcher for [Storecoin](http://storeco.in/) while in school, and have done web development coops at [Redbrick](https://rdbrck.com/) and [Bambora](https://www.bambora.com/en/us/).

I write [blog posts](https://medium.com/@jordanmmck) and (rarely) make [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/Brock34Landers) on the subject of cryptocurrencies, and I run a [Slack channel](https://vicblockchain.now.sh/) called VicBlockchain where we discuss all things crypto, organize meetups, etc.

I can be reached at [jordanmmck@gmail.com](mailto:jordanmmck@gmail.com).

I am a 4th year Computer Science student at UVIC, currently on an 8 month co-op at Bambora in Victoria. My main interests are Blockchain technology, Machine Learning, and AI.

I made this site as a project showcase and a place to publish essays, explanations and tutorials. Most articles posted here will also be posted on Medium.

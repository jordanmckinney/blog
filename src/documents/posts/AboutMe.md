<img src="/public/images/headshot.jpg" id="headshot" alt="headshot"/>

I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at UVIC.
I've worked for 1 year as a web developer co-op (4 months at Redbrick, 8 months at Bambora).

I write blog posts and make YouTube videos on the subject of cryptocurrencies, and I run a Slack channel called VicBlockchain where we discuss all things crypto, organize meetups, and so on.

My goal once finished school is to move into the finance and investing side of crypto.

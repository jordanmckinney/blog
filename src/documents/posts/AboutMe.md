I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at UVIC.
I've worked for 1 year as a web developer co-op (4 months at [Redbrick](https://rdbrck.com/), 8 months at [Bambora](https://www.bambora.com/en/us/)).

I write [blog posts](https://medium.com/@jordanmmck) and make [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/Brock34Landers) on the subject of cryptocurrencies, and I run a [Slack channel](https://vicblockchain.now.sh/) called VicBlockchain where we discuss all things crypto, organize meetups, etc.

My goal after graduating this December is to work as an analyst at a crypto investment fund.

I used Sublime Text exclusively for quite a while and was pretty happy with it... That is, until I saw a truly skilled Vim user in action. I've been using Vim and Tmux for a few weeks now and have been gradually learning shortcuts and adding new customizations.

Zsh, Vim and Tmux each have a 'dotfile' where various settings can be changed/added: `.zshrc`, `.vimrc`, and `.tmux.conf` respectively. To implement any of the features below, add the specified command to the programs dotfile. Note: These files should be in your home directory. The dot at the start of the filename indicates that the file is hidden (in Ubuntu `Ctrl+h` will show hidden files). My dotfiles can be found [here](www.github.com/jordanmckinney/DotFiles).

General look of my current setup:

<center><h3>Composition and Abstraction</h3></center>

There are two 'layers' involved with technology. The physics layer consists of the raw materials available to us along with physical laws governing them. The technology layer is everything we build on top of the physics layer. What we can create in the technology layer is limited by the physics layer, and further limited by our incomplete understanding of the physics layer.

Our technology advances gradually as we learn to more skillfully work with our materials. It advances more quickly when we find creative ways to combine our materials into new technology. But the biggest advancements come when we discover new materials with unique combinations of properties, and especially when we discover **brand new properties altogether**.

Metal has properties of hardness, ductility, malleability, and electrical conductivity. When we discovered metal we noticed its obvious physical properties and used them to great effect. Thousands of years later we found electricity hiding inside this favorite of materials. Here was a brand new property unlike anything we had seen before. Unlike hardness, weight, flexibility, and other simpler properties this one was ethereal and transitory, like fire but more subtle. Recently we have come to understand this property and the world has been utterly transformed.

Each time we discover new properties, or better understand old ones we expand the physics layer that our technology can be built upon, we gain new building blocks. In the technology layer a similar process occurs. We find ways to combine the fundamental building blocks into new technology, but we also abstract these inventions into technological 'units' and then use *those* as our building blocks.

Once someone invents the wheel, others can use this design and even improve upon it without having to reinvent it. Once someone combines gears, pulleys, pistons and fire into an engine we can all use the engine as a building block. We can then forget about how it works and just abstract it to a black box that has a certain properties. The engine has a certain size, outputs heat, requires fuel to run, and produces rotational power.

When computers were invented we were presented with an entirely new technological *platform*. Everything computers do of course still belongs to the physical world, but we now had a platform where we could bring completely abstract mathematical 'machinery' to life. Previously mathematical concepts had to run on the hardware of human minds, but we can now set them running outside of any mind.

Naturally the same process of abstraction and composition is happening on this platform as had occurred in the macro physical realm. Simple units of logic are composed into mathematical operations, which are composed into functions, which are composed into programs. These mathematical machines require only a little bit of electrical power and run shockingly fast and without complaint.

The most fascinating thing about this new realm is that some of these mathematical machines are unlike *anything we could ever imagine* existing in the physical world. And we have only just begun this process of exploring the vast landscape of math in search of these abstract creatures that we can animate with electricity.

Public key cryptography and cryptographic hash functions are two such animals that have recently found a very interesting use case in crpytocurrencies and the emerging field of cryptoeconomics. In the next post I look at some of the properties of hash functions and the interesting ways in which these properties have been used so far.

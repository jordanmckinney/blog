Think of economies, currencies and markets. What in our society can be interpreted as having this form, or would funciton better if it were to take on this form. Or, what new things could we invent that would have this form that would benefit us. Because we can now marketize everything.

Why could we not do this before? Well a market has buyers and sellers and the prices of everything should be fluid and also the supply for all things should be fluid. We obviously do have markets. But take file storage or internet traffic for example. We cannot currently create a market for packets in a decent internet because to do that we need it all to be done programmatically. The software must set prices, accept payment, make payment etc. That was not possible before but now it is. So we've got the ability now for code to do basically anything we want with money. 

We can then allow a router to take payment from peers in order to route its packet. And we can easily program it to take the highest paying packets first and leave us enough bandwidth for whatever we are doing. 

Everything can be viewed as economies. There is a sort of economy going in with cells in your body. The cells consume oxygen which is carried to them by blood which is like the currency. They trade carbon dioxide for the oxygen. 

Everything that can be decentralised, will be. Decentralisation is 'where water goes', where it flows naturally. This is the most efficient way for systems to operate.
